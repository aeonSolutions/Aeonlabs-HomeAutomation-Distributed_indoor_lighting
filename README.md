# Distributed Indoor Lighting 

**ideia**

The main ideia on this project is to provide a wider range of indoor light quality by using an alternative way of lighting instalation using [adressable LED](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dkg2mch)  and also [micro LED](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DeuCeEl)  for complementing lighting of a room.


<br>

### Current Status of Development

The current status of development of this project has now the following preliminary conclusions:

- A dressing room with an area of 20-25 m2 and with a glass window where the sun shines only in early morning can be powered 
  - by a single photovoltaic 6V DC solar cell for micro LED illumination usages of up to 5 to 10min a day and at night. 
- A bathroom with an area of 20-25 m2 , indoors no glass windows , with glossy tile walls , micro LED illumination produces the best light

Initially i was aiming at an additional 10 euro a month savings on the utilities bill , however, recent prototypes show that is possible to repurpose any apartment on any big city to become independent of the main power grid for the following home appliances :

  - indoor illumination
  - small home appliances such as a battery powered vacuum cleaner , manual operated or a robot
  - Smart devices such as smartphones, tablets or any other smart appliance
  - OLED TV screens, and laptop computers

Additional energy savings can be achieved, if installed with a "home occupancy management system" to monitor occupants habits:
- to provide an optimized electricity usage schedule to each of the occupants
- to detect empty an room/ compartment
- to regulate light intensity during evenings and at night before going to bed.  Synchronizing with the human biological clock cycles.

### Available PCB Designs as KiCad Project files for DIY and Makers

[<img src="https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/blob/main/tindie_amazing_small.jpg" alt="" height="60">](https://www.tindie.com/stores/aeonlabs/)


This public PCB catalogue features PCB desings that are not fully tested or require minor changes to the PCB or shcematics. Suited to all DIY and Makers in electronics, however a regular user may find him/her self in need to read components datasheets before any usage of the PCB is possible.

If time (or datasheets) are not your thing, there are more PCB designs with circuit schematics fully tested and working ready to download, available to all who donate or sponsor my open hardware work. Click [here for fully tested PCB designs and circuit chematics](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/tree/main/Fully-Tested-Working-PCB-Catalogue). To order a custom PCB acording to your specifications and needs , go [here](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/tree/main/custom_PCB).
